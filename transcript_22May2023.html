Yeah, I just seen it for what it&#39;s for telephone points marketing, which I don&#39;t have a lot information because we haven&#39;t done a lot of service if it&#39;s up to you to find somebody for help out. But I thought</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;2:57 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;d bring you guys here and show everybody we didn&#39;t make we do a better job sharing calendars.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;3:05 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that&#39;s one thing. Daniel in the shadows over there. Is is joining the team here and product management so yeah, Daniel, did I give you access to California yet? I haven&#39;t have not yet.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;3:24 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right now. Rome is but so with points. It&#39;s good news. Good news that polls is not tanking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;3:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Right because of course tanks and so there&#39;ll be a lot of pessimism immediately, but it could take and then it could go up, you know, and I have to remind myself that it&#39;s not an overnight thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;3:58 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So I have this dashboard here I&#39;ll show you guys that here as you can see</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;4:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this Oh WordPress Romeo put this together he&#39;s really the only personal team that knows WordPress you don&#39;t know WordPress, right? Yeah. Was that mean Yep. Do you know? Yes, I have an extra skill to see if you use WordPress right. Experience and press a long time ago. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like too complex around that recompilation but run we had to kind of learn from scratch all right. So Rommel just disconnected. I figured stuff out. All right, Dale. So now you have access to a few changes as you want and I&#39;m gonna go and copy the password into was a copy into WhatsApp. Sure. Sure. But now when you go there, basically you can see on the front desk. You can see on the front end right here, so click points. Once you&#39;re logged in, then you can see on the front end, we have Yeah. So I guess this is a product that falls your your purview was concerned about giving you too much information at one time. Bill Freecad was asked questions is a site is pretty much ready to go. I mean, at least to get up there. We should clean it up a little bit. I just told Carlos to look through it and he&#39;s looking at you on this nice oh make sense. Sarah, one thing I noticed over here we should copy it. How host copies is of course chain sacrifice. So I got a question for you guys because Brent had said something that kind of like confused me. But I want to make sure we&#39;re seeing things lightweight. So first of all, rate per 10,000 sacrifice points. That&#39;s probably more clear. Compare so it should say rate 1000 I think we&#39;ll do 1000 rate 2000 points. That should be over here. Right? You&#39;re saying what that means, Daniel. You&#39;ll hear so see that. What do you think that means when you heard that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;7:11 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not really sure I not familiar with this topic.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;7:15 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I never take guests. They&#39;re saying you&#39;re great. People are gonna give this amount of money. They&#39;re gonna give this amount of money. And here you have days analyze this for me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;7:30 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m assuming that people are getting more money for the same amount of points. Every day they keep holding it well after the first five</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;7:43 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">well, they&#39;re not okay. They&#39;re giving more money. Because the amount of points after day five. They&#39;re donating money. So it&#39;s the opposite. So you want to give in the beginning. You know, I think I gave over here some bullshit. Because I thought I did. And I told other people I helped people to submit and then I did it again. And so that&#39;s lots of money from that. But I asked that because you know, it&#39;s important first as clear as possible, especially to know that so said we should put that over here in the title. And you know, like, I mean, there&#39;s different ways we can think about it, right? We have this here, very small here. But it kind of has to be if we&#39;re going to continue from over here. If we just had one like these guys, too, right? But we could make a little chart here. And then because here we get the question. I don&#39;t know the visual thing, is this good? Or, you know, do we change it? And of course we can do it now like this and then six months we can change how the whole chart looks as well. When this is ready, go get me thoughts on this</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;9:03 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right away I can&#39;t tell you anything right now because I need a lot more context.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;9:07 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;9:20 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Comes to care of graphics, and so on our picture and I know were</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;9:36 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pretty resistant.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;9:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Your need to do some statistics is better to have one can like</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;9:51 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we were saying we are going to apply for truth is at work every single day.

So what&#39;s winning here is this sort of has to have paid starting May 1 or whatever want to start and learns that play suits and then decide should say what that is in. Spades over here is wrong. Okay. All right. So you know, the spacing here. There&#39;s no reason that will the space space.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;11:19 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most of our space</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;11:25 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we download over here. There&#39;s no reason that it wants to clean stuff up. I know you haven&#39;t had a lot of design interaction with asbestos. But don&#39;t be lazy about buying. Printers are very lazy by design. It&#39;s important that the liberal skills that are helped now this is good. But given coordinates and we have decided Alex office</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;12:08 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we decided we should put up here</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;12:17 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you guys can see this. We got to fix this up a little bit here too. And then we said we&#39;re at the top Okay, now think about sacrifice. So really we&#39;re going to try and push</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;12:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or just go first of all we don&#39;t do that. Now we gotta reverse right? We&#39;re gonna have a go here and we&#39;re just gonna live with the other guys do. But we&#39;re basically telling people</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;12:53 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">send money over here now, right? So what&#39;s the most effective way and gives you email? So it could be something like so we have a page for your sacrifice which would probably give you some feedback at the top say something like send, you know, this, this or this, this 10 point to this address. You know, we&#39;re about to start a sacrifice, right array of top feed writing and an ad here. Should they learn more? That will say something else and then say sacrifice and that will go down through this picture. Unless you guys have right</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;13:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we&#39;ll</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;13:54 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the reason why we&#39;re more is because I think that most people when they first go to the page, they probably won&#39;t instantly hit the buy button until they actually learn what the product is. Or whatever it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;14:06 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a lot of airship should take</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;14:07 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you to one of the informative sections we have to decide but wherever we want them to actually start. Maybe in the sacrifice sections, maybe learn more discusses sacrifice section that shows the details</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 4 &nbsp;14:27 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right so I think it should be worth it should we only got</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;14:35 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one thing wrong here. I think you&#39;ll you know, you&#39;ll see more as you get more technology and stuff especially as the market size. It&#39;s all about conversions. So for example, if you go on to any Google ads, if ever seen Google ads of a company that has shitty ads. Always go to a page and you look at the page it should be a page related to what you searched for.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;15:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Medicaid optimizations you have an experience of seeing Medicaid optimization.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;15:17 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some words I mean, you write ideally, you want to be landing on a page that has actual call to action, some kind of action you want the user to perform. Otherwise, if it&#39;s not that then it&#39;s some kind of like you said direct information related to what they search for otherwise I&#39;m closing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;15:37 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, yes. So it&#39;s experiences read through craftsperson, the market crafters. These will have we had no money and we had a budget and we had to send people and make the case and we have 60,000 People just time that you organized. And if someone looked at physics, well, you know that might cost $12 And he looked virgin COVID then that might cost $2 When he type in G codepage. Five, are you looking for a change? Check below we have and we have an addict who has more and more tests, what&#39;s the conversion rate? What&#39;s the same time other deals involve losses? All those little things? You got to remember, whatever, you get 100 People come to a page and two people actually pay money. So to make that page a little better. So you can three people make money. That how did you change your revenue? You didn&#39;t change 1% You changed it 50% from two to three weeks. So it makes a massive impact. And</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;16:56 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">also your local pages two pages, maybe a little higher. Why like</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;17:11 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">three seconds. Now, you know so when you click on here to go sacrifice what it says learn more. It should be learn more about the sacrifice. Now that neither of us I know a lot of people will fall down and sacrifice and and they&#39;ll be like, Oh, hold on. That&#39;s fine right now maybe my theory&#39;s wrong. Maybe it is too a good company will have to export. So okay, what what things replace and then it&#39;s difficult to track if we have any kind of heat maps and IMAP associations to like that. I don&#39;t even know what&#39;s what cheap technologies out there. But while I emphasize is it&#39;s it&#39;s all about conversions, and assume everyone has sanely short attention spans which tried to, you know, buy tokens or that or it&#39;s okay that sacrifice you&#39;re</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;18:24 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">supporting. Right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;18:28 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyway and also the other reality situation it&#39;s going to be it&#39;s going to be about most people I think, correct. But yeah, so we have this and then we also are going to come up with our processes as soon as possible. Has anyone had any ideas about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;19:01 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Daniel has been involved in everything</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;19:07 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not No, not yet. Kind of touching that with another project right now. But I&#39;m not directly involved. What do they do? They&#39;re a mobile game developer. They&#39;re basically trying to get the funding for a mobile game with with the features</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;19:28 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that come with referrals to the website.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;19:31 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know much about it&#39;s not about being allowed. I know that their their planning referrals. thing have only started with them maybe about a week ago, so not firing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;19:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. Yeah. Don&#39;t tell me anyway. So we need to research different concepts though referral systems are very common when you have stuff like sign up for Coinbase in fact, get requests. Right which actually Hey, wait, you want an account in California? up to like $1,000 was put in there because it&#39;s great. That&#39;s true. But I&#39;m more concerned about the referral systems for pre Ico for sacrifice things and stuff like that. And, you know, we have ideas to do that. Inside the NDA. Yeah, yeah, I have. Alright, so, one thing that we&#39;d like to do, and I mentioned that because you know, this one&#39;s confidential here. I think that there are some methods that hasn&#39;t been fully exploited. So I really need your research, of forcing people to give unique phone numbers. If you&#39;re already part of peripherals unique non voice right people. So, okay, thank you for this phone number. We&#39;re gonna give you some free money for this. And if you get your friends to sign up, we&#39;ll give them free my use. They get some money. So you get this, whatever we can do. So you&#39;re not making 1000 fake accounts, but you&#39;re telling your friends and you&#39;re rewarded if our objectives are met, whether the objective is how long they sign up or better. They give some fuel be more direct, they give a crypto and then we&#39;ll give you a bonus on top of that. So we could say something like, Hey, you know, this first day. Its first day you get $10 A crypto and you get 10,000 points. But if someone referred you to us, then you get 12,000 points, you get 20% More, and that person gets another 20% more. Well, that will tell people to tell people and either way we still get 20 bucks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;22:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can be like after the successful registration 1235 defaults to get this. That&#39;s how the referral systems works.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;22:21 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, you want you want a specific goal at the end of that because if you&#39;re just giving people this sort of just because you&#39;re signing up there, they&#39;re gonna come up with some creative ways to get new phone numbers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;22:39 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You guys are complete each other. And I said that if they give us money, then we give them extra points.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;22:51 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was directly positive.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;22:54 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But another idea is to say, more or less direct form, which is just sign up and then we give you something and then Daniel is concerned because it&#39;s just sign up, give me something as well cost accounts. But I think what&#39;s special about this is that they can&#39;t make fake accounts to the API controller or something like that. Sergei, give me your phone number so that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;23:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we can reuse raishin</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;23:36 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and validation on the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;23:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">validation with the with the food API that only allows not us was repeated. I&#39;ve seen them. Do that take us I don&#39;t know Italy or in South Africa or they&#39;ve left that matter. But there&#39;s I tried to use my 917 number for everything I sign up for some things. You know. For example, what they know Ooh, boy, did you get the voice and the other we should be careful that does exist. Okay. And we have because there are websites that exists to allow you to put a random number in there. And we got to make sure those don&#39;t work that will generate for infinity. Right. So I should get the lead pages and I should download Chevron Chevron, Chevron. I mentioned Chevron the gas company, because I was going to get them and they said what you remember. And then you&#39;re right to kill. It was in Africa. But they want the referral systems. Yeah, they&#39;ll have it our rules. So if it&#39;s hackable, then all bets are off, right? But if it&#39;s not hackable or a hypothetical, a very small amount of like five is hackable, but very rare. Then we can say to your max five I want to find some not so assume for the terms of the day not. So you need to have a real tough acting phone number. So you know how many people would you love to say, Hey, do this, this and this and then you&#39;re gonna get some money for that might mean for the mic, maybe a wallet. The wallet that the two years worth?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;25:40 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, look, I mean, you&#39;re right. It&#39;s I think the like if you put it that way they the efforts that you would have to go through just doesn&#39;t make it worth you know, 50 reward isn&#39;t, you know, more than a couple of bucks then.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;25:58 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You know, also it&#39;s kind of like that effort is also telling something about systems. We look forward to it. We are friends noise that way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;26:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I forget that. Yeah. But the thing is, you&#39;re giving some value away for for something that when it&#39;s real is very simple to do. But so the idea is that just you know, so it&#39;s almost like a balance you know, if the if the money that you&#39;re you know, the value that you&#39;re offering as the reward you&#39;re offering is sort of significant. When it&#39;s really easy to achieve because you&#39;ve got a real phone number, but it&#39;s got to be a difficult sort of small enough to make it worth me investing time and time into this as time into defrauding this.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;26:51 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All right, well, how much let&#39;s say you so then comes question of where it is worth. Right? So let&#39;s say I gave you words for 20% Whatever, it&#39;s just gonna be something you got to then get back to be 1000 people, but by the end great. If you&#39;re going to tell your friends then why are 1000s equals $100 as they put this money in, or it&#39;s $100. Okay, go sign up for this service. They sign up, and then you say, Okay, now, every time you do sign up as me cuts out the wall before the desks</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;27:40 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before that, right when you sign up, you don&#39;t have to give us your wallet. If you&#39;re doing wallet to Thanksgiving rolls, we will give you 15 A wallet, a little booklet or database as well, as much later on. We&#39;re gonna send it back to you. Control that was almost a monument yourself. So you have 1000 wallets and then you have to somehow defend the value of 1000 phone numbers, and then somebody&#39;s probably used. You have put a lot of money and then you get more money on top of that. Even as doubles it&#39;s still a fucking pain to ask you about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;28:23 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and also, I mean, I&#39;m kind of picking up the sort of what&#39;s coming around. I mean, if I have to put in money to do this, then like, I mean, I might be missing something there. But then what do we carry if people want to do this repeatedly?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;28:45 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We care about if people lose access to the system. So if you put a million dollars, and I put $100 and it&#39;s gonna screw me and you know, there&#39;s because it&#39;s evaluating. It&#39;s you&#39;re patrolling the pool and you know that you&#39;re rich and I&#39;m not rich,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;29:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right? But we&#39;re proportionately</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;29:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rich. If I put in a million and you put in 100, then</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;29:19 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you get a million and you didn&#39;t deserve it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;29:25 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, but the thing is, I essentially what you&#39;re saying here is, okay, so if Daniel puts in 100 bucks, and he refers Sergey and Sergey puts 100 bucks, then basically, Daniel and Sergey Babu both gets 20% worth more of the rewards. Right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;29:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;29:49 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, what we&#39;re what we&#39;re saying here, then is that you&#39;re essentially willing to give let&#39;s call it Yeah, up to 20% more bonus points. If you&#39;re getting more money in</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;30:05 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no way more than more bonus points. If you&#39;re bringing a friend then who&#39;s gonna be a participate Okay, so</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;30:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is this is important than okay, that&#39;s additional context. So you&#39;re not just after the investment in this case, in which case you don&#39;t care if it&#39;s Daniel and Sergey or if it&#39;s to Daniel&#39;s a five Daniels or whatever, you still care about the actual person itself. You want them to be that&#39;s your Okay, cool. So, in that case,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;30:33 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would think about it right. What should I care? What should I care about? Now, I mean, and you could do both if both gave extra money, extra points for people that gave more money, they had the pipeline and they&#39;re old enough Why is the Middle East and actually if you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;30:52 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do then you can kind of solving the problem though, because if I&#39;m gonna do this, so that I can get more rewards because I&#39;m donating more money, then you can just have that as a tear look, you know, if you had donating 100 bucks, then this is it. Thank you. Very much up there anything 1000 You know what, we&#39;ll give you an extra 10% on four</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;31:10 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">points or whatever.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;31:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But that&#39;s, you know, in parallel with then the referral system because then if you don&#39;t have 1000 bucks, but you want to get some extra points. Then you got another option, and it&#39;s easy enough. So,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;31:27 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now, the referral system that gives you a word of no matter what if your friend puts in what you found 100 You still have that extra sample? Yes. But if</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;31:35 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you want to invest a certain amount and you want to be sort of rewarded more for your larger amount, then that might be should be an option as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;31:44 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that&#39;s you know, yeah. That can be kind of stability system. We&#39;ll get more money you sacrifice more pointy bit sound logical layer so that Yeah. Yeah, and I think it does exist. I don&#39;t even know honestly, if it was like said by Richard Hart in the beginning for what it was on like some other websites we like I&#39;d say that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;32:18 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;m not sure</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;32:26 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you know, Carlos would remember more of a legal look. There was something though and it was something he was encouraged Wales. What is that curve? Right. This is some kind of progression</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;32:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it&#39;s just a maybe a sort of a curve progression of the increase in medical data. Maybe Yeah, yeah. Or maybe the data the dates or not, because you got the 10th and you got the 21st. And the 25th, I think is just to account for the sort of, no, but it&#39;s a straight line of no background maybe maybe it&#39;s just not a linear progression.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;33:33 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is linear, right and 3% per day, it was the rate here. Am I missing something? Help me out with my brain squad right now. If we&#39;re doing 3% per day Is it usable ether fees, or real estate seven? That&#39;s right. No, no, no,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;33:54 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hang on. You&#39;re comparing apples and oranges. Here. What you&#39;ve got there is a current per sacrifice and you got vintages over day and on the other graph there you got actual dollar value something it&#39;s something else I think.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;34:11 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Check it out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;34:14 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So that there you go. rate per 10,000 sacrifice points in dollars. thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;34:22 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that&#39;s what it was absolutely. This, I said what 1.3 1.37 power, right. So five. Well, what is 12 over here? Is that 1.22 Is that half the money</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;34:43 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Excel. So of course</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;34:51 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we have an example Excel charts very easily can go out and do the rate. Since like we made 250 Or do they do 3%? Exactly as if you&#39;re raising it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;35:02 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the power then it&#39;s going to be exponential and therefore it&#39;s going to be right so let&#39;s</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;35:11 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">let&#39;s do it again. 4.3 to the power of 14 Yeah. So it should be a little bit curved.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;35:27 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So you see you got you did 14 Okay, no, hang on. Yeah, yeah, nevermind, sir. I forgot about the first five.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;35:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, sir, I have to leave so</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;35:37 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then that let&#39;s raise that back to visually go back to original questions. This right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;35:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hold on wait $10 per person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;35:56 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She that&#39;s how I meant you got percentages. They got actual values that sort of meant that were inside that you know, comparing the same thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;36:03 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But no, what I&#39;m saying is that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;36:13 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yeah, and obviously you&#39;re right, this is percentages. We should make it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;36:21 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whatever the hell they had. I think they had you know, we should double check what was uh, what was going around like crazy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;36:31 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">YouTube shit.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;36:33 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So there needs to be some cohesion on how it makes sense. And it has the confusion and how folks and we did. Right. And I think it&#39;s going to be a little parabolic. I think we&#39;ll have dollar amounts over here. And I think, you know, but I got this stuff. So there&#39;s a</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;36:58 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">good chance it was double check. How do I teach? Right and let&#39;s think about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;37:05 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what are the answers make sense with the Street analyst the wrong things, but also, we want to make it look for the possible understanding quickly. And we want to be from a logical standpoint rate compared to looking at his getting go, I made this I think this is using it makes it you know, it was a cost per 1000</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;37:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">points,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;37:38 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or rate for 1000 points. Look, why didn&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;37:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I mean, I&#39;m gonna struggle here without additional context. Why don&#39;t you and I have a chat at some point and you explain to me what this is exactly. And maybe, you know, give me some time to like, do some of my own research and figure out what the sacrifice and whatnot is and how this works. And then we can figure out we need to figure out what it is that you want to depict here. What what it is that these grasses show, and then I can work on something for you. I love how</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;38:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">everybody seems to have was impacted. But so you&#39;re on the spot here, but let me let me try to anyway. Basically, your sacrifices, so they&#39;re giving money technically, for the purpose of to prove the medical cannabis to the pilot test. There FAQs so you can read this year Claire was meant to help medical patients using cannabis producers, every piece on blockchain technology aims to be one first democratic and really want to insist for everyday use held up will be a community, which is illegal states can receive discounted coupons for cannabis exchange. We should make several states and countries in exchange for providing demographic consumers sir surveys are brands and dispensaries.

I don&#39;t know. 25. They said that the market size is 25 billion so mountain looks only 25 What is the focal size began to speed up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;39:56 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&#39;t have an edge that actually depends a lot on what you mean by kind of his data you including the cannabis sales data or are you talking about specific medicinal data? Because that&#39;s not a lot. I mean, there&#39;s there&#39;s some but not as much as we&#39;re not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;40:17 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or we just get rid of data and we&#39;re data and now you have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;40:22 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, I think that&#39;s good enough.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;40:25 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Really read like cannabis things are second can restate that. So let&#39;s reference to the main like cannabis industry because it&#39;s kind of the connection of one thing to another and the other thing we can measure is life. References to like actual data in cannabis industry. And for me when I&#39;m reading this, it is not so clear at what standard value it get as investor personal money they hate bad person.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;41:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I&#39;ll be okay</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;41:15 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with was looking at that.

We are not promising we&#39;re not giving investment advice. And we&#39;re not promising that you&#39;re going to make money on this. We&#39;re going to make life with this. We are using utility we&#39;re using a crypto that has purpose and that purpose today is the Cambridge system to and you&#39;re also twice your money because you want us to do well. And that means that we&#39;re going to help people with medical benefits in the future. We might so it&#39;s a conflict right? It&#39;s often pretty saying that and saying hey what does he has and not saying that we need to beach that people we get money but we need to beach something here we need to do exactly well you fool the people will invest what they will get it can be like emotional seats. So be part of something big. Like yeah, well. You guys are here as well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;42:45 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Here&#39;s a quick question for you. I mean the key points are they like I&#39;m still a little fuzzy on are they actually worth anything to the user that gets them ultimately what can they do with them?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;42:57 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They can cash them out and it&#39;d be gone from price to pay to other Kryptos California.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;43:04 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, all right. So essentially you can you get a crypto, you can trade on the exchange or any other crypto or Fiat, okay, or</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;43:14 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or you can go and get some tenancies from us. Which which I don&#39;t necessarily</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;43:23 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know I remember we discussed that yesterday briefly. Yeah. So, okay. So then the the is there any other use of the of the tokens in general? Okay, so that&#39;s, that&#39;s for me as the user who gets it. What is the use of the tokens you mentioned that they&#39;re going to be used? To fund the rest of the of the charity medicine of the of the sort of right, so</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;43:51 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we are going to take tokens for every transaction, right and give it to someone. We&#39;re going to give the person get little amounts to dispensaries have little maps of brands, and a little mouth to a charity. Charity is going to automatically cash out taxes every month. It&#39;s going to keep until we decide to cash cash. And that surely money goes to buy cannabis for patients in need they can&#39;t afford. And the reason I want to cash half out is because I don&#39;t want to wait for three years for patients with the medicines. But I don&#39;t want to cash it all out. Because now so that as we make a decision where we think that the best for the charities, right,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;44:43 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">can I ask a couple of more questions? What&#39;s</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;44:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the question over here? Is, does it make sense if we say how to various feel close to the entrance also feelings and soon to be multiple candidates without the word data? It makes</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;45:06 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sense because to be honest with you, I don&#39;t think there is a cannabis data market right now there is data in the cannabis market. But there isn&#39;t a date a cannabis data market.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;45:21 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay. But there are companies with US companies who are thinking about data and thinking about it. Yeah. Look, I think if per se</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;45:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">per se that Pro is it&#39;s a very big thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;45:40 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then of course, is we&#39;re all telling people, Hey, we&#39;re not a marijuana company. You&#39;re a freak out, but I think you can enter the cannabis market by data, that if you still function for us, but you&#39;ll give us more data. Yeah, sir. Do you agree with that? Famous data here? I do I do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;46:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were sure that enemies diva</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;46:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">market assumption separate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;46:16 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They do.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;46:18 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They demand the company you mentioned but they are I believe part of the whole industry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;46:28 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Technically, that one was meant to categorize so you guys know. We are ancillary cannabis business. Carlos what are the names of other ancillary?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;46:46 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My company name protecting it all you do all day from the stuff that I&#39;m okay. With what?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;47:07 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh they don&#39;t sell. They don&#39;t distribute but they are involved in the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;47:19 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">market business. Let&#39;s say to be like this carries software for you know, for dispensaries for distribution. Yeah, that&#39;s the first thing. I&#39;ll have the correct software. Thanks. Lawyers especially all the consultants, everybody. That&#39;s why that matters. Here&#39;s a good example. Peerless is an ancillary cannabis company. We we get money from cannabis companies. We really have more money from the ones who were in that world and they were ancillary and curious as to what to chase. And for me, Chase was paired with me. I said, What are you doing over and over? We have a new round available candidates. Oh, we don&#39;t approve of promoting candidates and the conversation ended with the screening good shape manager because he was the way to get a promotion. And there&#39;s some businesses so that&#39;s why it&#39;s so much a it&#39;s a we&#39;re we will help him we will not pretend right? So if we weren&#39;t a cannabis company, then we&#39;d have to get likes to California. Anyways, the answer is gonna be we want to miss it or not. And also for people that are a little bit paranoid about saying, Wait, am I giving money to marijuana company or flop? Yeah, give me another chance. Because it sounds crazy. But let&#39;s say Kickstarter, or GoFundMe. There&#39;s a firefighter here. There&#39;s some fire philosopher farms. Who didn&#39;t have insurance. It&#39;s hard to get cannabis. So people started to fund me and they might donate money for the farmers and GoFundMe shuts out. I&#39;m sorry, our team provider will not give money to Kansas. Right. So Gotcha. But that middle thing exists in Jannatul. Not worried about that. Message wise, but you&#39;re right, we are hinting members will say hey, we&#39;re not a candy company. We&#39;re a data company choosing to scale we&#39;ll have to pay any federal laws.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;50:04 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So to the whole now, the only question</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;50:12 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right, yeah, so I want to talk a little bit more about the tokens. So you said that from every transaction, the portion goes, you know, to convert to tokens or something and then anyway, the tokens are generated at contract transactions being using a coupon or just any purchase through the platform. First to the last through the platform platform. First of all, is there a purchasing through the platform or is it just coupons?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;50:46 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, a platform today even tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;50:50 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the next day will be good. I wasn&#39;t just seeing a random site that I thought about before. It&#39;s like gambling with crypto. who knows we might have you know, hey, here&#39;s the raffle. One this will make things fun. And anyway, but the point is using so the answer questions probably down the line. It&#39;s like, hey</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;51:30 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hey, do you specifically you got</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;51:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right, you can use my court system. But the main step is going to get this man want to make the purchase and use the coupon for reading. Right?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;51:47 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then also, you don&#39;t get semantics with life. You could say you get</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;51:58 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how it&#39;s paid. And then you redeem that tell me for Kelly&#39;s point by pressing this button and send it to us,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;52:06 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">or a California did you have to click on redeem them to make sure they actually tend to go into the walks? Yeah,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;52:15 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when you redeem them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;52:18 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When you redeem them, there&#39;s gonna be some transactions. And a question that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;52:28 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I think you&#39;ll be set for consumer transactions. And if that transaction fee ends up being very high, it will kind of destroy your model.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;52:41 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And that&#39;s Gatsby. Look, I think, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;52:46 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then you have to wait to supposedly gold&#39;s disposed to add a little gas. We can check where it is. It was higher than we thought and right now folks work</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;53:01 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">together bridge class and what the hell&#39;s going on. So the goal</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;53:10 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now, later on the level a different level, find out right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;53:17 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Okay, so then if, okay, so if I&#39;m getting these these points in the app, and I redeem them to get the actual crypto Is there anything in the app that I can do? With those points? So that because if there&#39;s any, anything that I can use these points with, within the app, then moving it out into the actual crypto is kind of like an additional optional extra. You can do that but there&#39;s value to be had in within the app itself. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;54:00 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yes, and you&#39;re the reason you want that is why?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;54:04 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because then there is a reason for you, as the user to keep the points as at points, let&#39;s convert them into actual crypto and not have to worry about those high gas fees, or that I might have to pay and it kind of for us it we&#39;re giving the user basically, a way to use</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;54:38 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in addition to that, what is our goal? Yeah, like people between these points within the app transfers and trades and and so on. What is our goal? To do this? Yeah</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;55:00 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you can definitely used in some capacities to get our NFPs overpriced, 3d image beautiful piece of that might sell for $10,000. And</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;55:18 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people don&#39;t put 10,000 FTEs. Because Oh, that&#39;s and my whole point is, so what</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;55:27 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we don&#39;t care for if people buy the NFT I just want somebody to be there. In fact, if they do buy it, we might burn out, which means we just give it up for burn particles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;55:45 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just to kind of make</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;55:47 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but to equitable about what the goal is original goal is twofold. One is to get as much money as possible sacrifices</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;55:59 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to go to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;56:03 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is going to be what we said or not to help encourage the price to rise. To add value to everybody. So nice about not cashing it out. Is that especially if we missed it for that, that&#39;s a big question right there. Is that my pecs if everyone keeps their money in there and they&#39;re not selling and then once a while new people can find it guess what every those are the two exciting enricher parts which are always stuck in my brain that I want to kind of analyze and it was the buyer and you ever had to try to analyze return statements? Exactly. It was very anti trees and everything. And he was like, Hey, everyone, you guys are fools. It was so strange in your trading. You&#39;re trying to you know, catch low, sell high.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;57:08 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the real money is actual change. And to get them to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;57:16 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and that was when he proposed who was buying and selling the crypto itself. Like trading back and forth. That one is still not 100. That is correct. Well, that means that I could only just maybe, because we&#39;ve been fairly I guess the I don&#39;t see why trickle down to but it says more. People are short the market maybe the charmer short. Anyway, but I like people want that. Right. So if people hold the crypto and we have minted and other people are buying it, then it should go up. Right? Sell it, buy something that was built to give credit to everybody. Everyone&#39;s going to sell it and then sell it, sell it. Then keep going down. It wants me to minimize people let&#39;s say that&#39;s right. Let&#39;s say Jeff is one of several attendees. It was like four bucks. So you buy $3 in crypto, but this is even worse. That is to say you need to have minimum $100 of credit, accumulated able to account which means nothing, because now you have $90 that you can go and do what you want with it or in keep on account. It also brings a question, okay. What type of things because people spend a crypto 4.4 on our accounts. They have the same kind of benefits. Yeah. And again, the idea is, we want to get to a stage where we&#39;re saying we want to see one day. You can buy cannabis with crypto right now there is a major problem with starting off like that. That major problem is that&#39;s going to put pressure on the price without so if I say hey, I got all these word points. I want to buy crypto for the dispensary. But your cash and we&#39;d say no problem. We use cash. We&#39;re going to take his coins, ourselves coins and the market value between those. We&#39;re going to give us the coin now first.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;59:55 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So what&#39;s stopping you from Norio from destroying the coins on that transaction? Without me that the standard?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:00:07 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bank has mics right but then didn&#39;t you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:00:09 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">get value from that point? Within those points are generated as</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;1:00:17 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a byproduct of a transaction therefore they carry some value. In other words, we are quote unquote allocating a piece of that transaction to the points and we&#39;re associating some of that value to those points and those points are created to have intrinsic value. This is actually a very rare case in crypto in my in my experience. I would say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:00:43 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that I don&#39;t know if I was when we launched</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:00:53 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it okay. We have affiliates of the little tricks. We did about three chips. We&#39;ll get 3% with the chips and I&#39;m getting the same sorts of adults $3.03 chips as people and then it goes on price Oklahoma now if dollar 50 Chip is is what it started at the beginning or later on the value is determined by what&#39;s the market rate and if we did either way, the dispensaries major cash. So we have to sell it for value to get that we can&#39;t versus right. lot, a lot a lot of stuff here. So</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:01:42 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will it be possible before</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:01:44 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was to buy a couple and then</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;1:01:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this will be kind of discount for dispensaries this kind of lump is it possible as possible because I think it comes down to what percent of a deal or what percent it was especially for the brand was loose. So you could say, well, we&#39;re already Thomas is already saying you fill out this form. Okay, you got to pay that first thing for dollars is in this box this box. Let&#39;s say the real class that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:02:35 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we worked on is this bedsheets, give household the the money. We&#39;re going to mail $5 at first and also give us $1 For our choices. That also come up right now. Have to say sure. I bust, crypto. Now, question of consumers want the crypto instead of five drops and I think that it is also the natural thing. But of course the answer is the vast majority people today would rather have the jobs. Right? So we&#39;re gonna get your dollars on top of that. We get the crazy things that we&#39;re going to be working on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:03:27 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And it&#39;s another people like like 3d shifting right now and doesn&#39;t have the depth but</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:03:35 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">either way, you&#39;re not solving the fundamental problems where people are giving it to people. You know, who is cashing out, putting some pressure on it? That&#39;s one issue. And the other issue is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:03:50 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nobody wants to force people to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:03:52 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have to do this whole crypto thing to be able to use a site and go to second</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:04:02 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is a thing though, I</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;1:04:03 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mean, I think that that then idea of utilizing the the tokens to urge other discounts or something I mean, my point would actually was like, if you have something of value that can be exchanged for these tokens, that does not that prevents basically people from cashing them out. You&#39;ve got the NF T&#39;s Gotcha. But then is there something like other discounts or tears or something that you can burn? 1000 points to get into tea or something like that, that gets you something out of some shit. Could you add to that?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:04:47 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Because that&#39;s a free press. That&#39;s fine. It will give me something that we have money on. Yeah, and he talks about one of my fundamental concerns of this whole thing is</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;1:05:01 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that the future thing, which is one day in the future, let&#39;s say we&#39;re really big.

So alright, well, if we could wrap this thing up here. That is evolution. And there&#39;s so many things as a way to figure out and do over time and it&#39;s easy to get so caught up in I&#39;m more concerned about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:09:38 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all of it right now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:09:50 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We&#39;re going to keep it would be nice if we just take all the money in California.

We&#39;re going to shoot it to people as we feel fit for the day for them. And or some other people go towards money for the customer.

We could say we&#39;re going to raise much money</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:11:56 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and we&#39;re also going to have money for marketing the question becomes how much that bonus you know, in raising money if you like well the money right.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:12:15 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So yeah, these are all questions. Is it Bernie for every transaction Oh, shoot, I want to give you a trillion that was gonna burn, you know, a million every day. Nothing</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 1 &nbsp;1:12:33 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is right, every transaction they&#39;re burning some of that stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:12:43 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">So tokenomics I think in general, we have solidified some stuff, which isn&#39;t specific. I think what&#39;s important as well,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;1:12:56 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">look, I think what&#39;s important as well as while you&#39;re thinking about that you also need to consider what&#39;s the actual use of the token is in the in the ecosystem. And the other question, I knew really have to go in like three minutes. The other question I had was, you said that a portion of those tokens goes to the dispensary and the owner or the brand. The brand, what do they do with that? What is the what&#39;s the value in it for them? Is it just purely the dollar value of that? Or is it do they utility for them in it? Yeah,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:13:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the plan was thought about</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;1:13:37 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right end the plan was given granted, essentially, is what it sounds like this course that can be can&#39;t be obeyed. We have values that you hope you otherwise else goes down. Always to behave the same as ours, six months from now. But I mean, your question, we have to make sure</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:14:03 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;1:14:08 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we&#39;re at now unless you want to buy a piece. And then at the lower price. Yeah, no, I mean, actual utility is yes, I think we&#39;re very limited 100 For sure we can do unless you&#39;re a big sort of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 3 &nbsp;1:14:34 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">creative in like figure out what advise people to use the phone for and use the points more outside of they want to make money they want to make</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:14:44 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they want to I mean, yeah, but you have</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 2 &nbsp;1:14:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you have an opportunity here to give guts, something that that has so can have tangible value. I still want to maybe, you know, maybe think about the concept. I haven&#39;t thought about it. I just missed an idea. That came to the context of, of having real tangible value attached at the time of creation. In other words, have the coins or the crypto produced or created at the time of the transaction and it&#39;s a it&#39;s a it&#39;s got a VAT dollar value, sort of associated to that crypto because of the of the transaction because that&#39;s where it&#39;s from. So in other words, maybe even go or lock up a piece of that transaction. Say for example, you know, you transaction is $100 it takes and you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:15:40 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">create that much worth of your</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:15:42 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crypto</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:15:44 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and that&#39;s how the crypto enters the market</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unknown Speaker &nbsp;1:15:48 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that might have come from us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Speaker 5 &nbsp;1:15:52 &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or you&#39;re going to have either the USD T in front of them might actually exist in the bank, which doesn&#39;t exist.
